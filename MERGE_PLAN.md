**Project Goal**: Deploy fully functional stevedores dashboard today
**Total Time Estimate**: 2 hours 15 minutes
**Started**: 2025-01-15

## Contributors' Work Summary

### Jules' Maritime Integration (Branch: maritime-integration)

- ✅ Cargo breakdown (vehicles, automobiles, heavy equipment, static cargo)
- ✅ Terminal targets (BRV, ZEE, SOU targets)
- ✅ JSON fields for complex data (deck, turnaround, inventory, hourly progress)
- ✅ Already integrated into current codebase

### Manus' Desktop Updates (Folder: desktop-stevedores-updates)
- ✅ Complete Flask app with enhanced forms and validation
- ✅ WTForms integration for all wizard steps
- ✅ Comprehensive maritime forms (MaritimeOperationStep1-4Forms)
- ✅ Enhanced HTML templates for 4-step wizard
- ✅ Production-ready app structure with proper error handling

## Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Core System Merge (30 min) - ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Integrate Manus' form validation with Jules' models
**Tasks**:
- [x] Copy Manus' `maritime_forms.py` to `/models/forms/maritime_forms.py`
- [x] Update ship operations routes to use enhanced forms
- [x] Copy Manus' enhanced templates to `/templates/maritime/`
- [x] Run database migrations
- [x] Test basic form functionality

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancement (45 min) - ⏳ IN PROGRESS
**Objective**: Add stevedoring-specific features and dashboard
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Merge maritime-integration branch features
- [ ] Add stevedoring-specific dashboard components
- [ ] Integrate team management features
- [ ] Add cargo tracking enhancements
- [ ] Update navigation and UI components

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (30 min) - ⏸️ PENDING
**Objective**: Complete workflow testing and validation
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test 4-step wizard workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Validate maritime operations CRUD operations
- [ ] Test offline PWA capabilities
- [ ] Verify user roles and permissions
- [ ] Test data persistence and validation

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (30 min) - ⏸️ PENDING
**Objective**: Deploy to production with monitoring
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Set up monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Test production functionality
- [ ] Final validation and sign-off

## Key Integration Points
- **Models**: Jules' enhanced MaritimeOperation model (already integrated)
- **Forms**: Manus' WTForms validation system
- **Templates**: Manus' enhanced wizard templates
- **Architecture**: Current production-ready Flask structure

## Risk Mitigation
- Database backup before migrations
- Git commits after each phase
- Parallel testing during development
- Rollback plan if issues arise

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 4-step wizard fully functional
- [ ] Maritime operations CRUD working
- [ ] Stevedore team management operational
- [ ] PWA capabilities intact
- [ ] Production deployment successful
